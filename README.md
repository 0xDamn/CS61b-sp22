   ## CS61C : Great ideas in Computer architecture

This repository contains all my learning resources for CS61C. I use the 2022 spring version because it open-sourced the lecture videos. You can watch the videos on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uS4y187Vi?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=c40d835873da22843989e1ed6e0d58c1).

Here is the [course website](https://cs61c.org/sp22/), you can find all the materials on it.

repository structure is as follows :

- Handouts: some additional reading materials, including some openMP learning materials
- Slides: course slides
- Discussions: TA discussion pdf and answers

---

This course puts all its labs on a seperate repository. 

- Labs: contains 11 labs , I put it in an [independent repository](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/CS61C-labs)

  - [ ] Lab02: 
  - [ ] Lab03:

The projects I chose the 2020 fall version, which is a little different than the 2020 summer version. You can use the "Semesters" button on the up-right of the website page to choose the semester.

- Projects: I did five projects, each project is a independent repository, the links below will redirect to the repository which contains my implementation.
